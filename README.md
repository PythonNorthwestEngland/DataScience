Files from our session(s) on Data Science
Files contain the problems discussed in the Data Science session on 21st September 2017.

All the problems use the PuLP library for access to linear solvers, the orange juice problems also use Pandas.

The guns problem is standalone, but the Orange Juice problems require the csv file.
